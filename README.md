### Face Emotion Recognition
1. Trial Datasets to be used: JAFFEE (Japanese Female Facial Emotions and Expressions)
2. Classification Methods: Linear (FLD or SVM), Non-Linear (Neural Networks)
3. Expected Accuracy: 90% - 95%

#### Steps:
1. Face Aqcuisation:
    a. Dataset - JAFFEE
    b. Dataset image pre-processing and gray-scaling
    c. Dataset segregation according to the labeled emotions
